title:  "S8F labs: The HMX protocol"
---

## HMX

TLDR; This is an idea for a radical new protocol: a trustless, crypto-backed
solution for moving and exchanging sensitive data through an untrusted network.
An alpha release is currently in development.

_HMX is a Message eXchange_, or a _Hacker Mail rolodeX_, whichever you prefer.

### Introduction

E-mail is, ironically, *the most popularly trusted AND least secure internet
protocol in wide use*. How do we explain that?

Believe it or not, many [highly](https://www.dropbox.com/)-[touted](http://www.google.com/hangouts/)
["cloud"](http://www.salesforce.com/company/privacy/security.jsp) [services](https://www.facebook.com/)
[out there](http://www.skype.com/) which claim to
support "encryption" or "privacy" do **NOT** actually maintain
[end-to-end encryption](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End-to-end_encryption).
What this means for you is, by using the service, you have agreed to let your
precious data be siezed, altered, or silently monitored by third parties without
your express permission!

Employees for these services have "backdoor" encryption
keys to decrypt your data. What's more, the NSA,
who has [paid RSA Security $10m USD](http://www.theverge.com/2013/12/20/5231006/nsa-paid-10-million-for-a-back-door-into-rsa-encryption-according-to)
to suppress the standardization of [superior crypto algorithms](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NTRU),
is [threatening secure email providers](http://www.zdnet.com/the-truth-about-why-silent-circle-silenced-their-secure-email-service-7000019300/),
and [illegally hacking the internet backbones](https://www.eff.org/nsa-spying)
to get at your data, in the name of "national security".

In light of all this, you owe it to yourself to protect your rights and to STOP
FEEDING THE MACHINE. HMX to the rescue.

### Features

- Security by default: end-to-end **4096-bit RSA** asymmetric, **256-bit AES** symmetric, and **Diffie-Hellman** ephemeral encryption.
- Future support for [NTRU](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NTRU), a quantum-computing-resistant lattice-based cryptography.
- Users don't have to trust servers. Servers are merely the custodians of identities (pubkeys), and encrypted data blobs, with NO KNOWN backdoor keys.
- The HMX protocol is designed for a minimum of info leakage, so your web of trust is safe from prying eyes and data miners.
- Servers **MAY** authenticate WHO is posting a message, but they **MUST NOT** record it, or any other metadata.
- Addresses look like (and can also function as) email addresses!
- Automatically verifies messages using double-encoded SHA256 digital signatures.
- All interactions are client-server. No central server, signing authority, p2p network, or agency required.
- BSD-licensed

### Goals for HMX alpha

- Mail sending and checking via CLI
- Optional encryption, optional signing
- Basic keyserver functionality
- Data on server is immutable, but has configurable (on server) TTL
- Configurable (on server) payload size cap and random padding
- Hashcash required upon upload

### HMX 1.0 and beyond

- Linking scheme to upload payload spanning multiple messages
- Support NTRU or equivalent. RSA may already be cracked, and performance and bandwidth are factors!
- Timed delete by sender
- Merkle Tree upload confirmation signatures and validation
- Advanced keyserver w/ searching
- Instant messaging app or something else fun
- Optionally use DNS TXT records to create custom HMX server pointers (`username@your-host.com`).
- Servers can require pre-registration and signature authentication
- Postage fees, paid via Bitcoin wallet identity on keyserver
