title:  "S8F labs: The HMX protocol"
---

HMX is a modern approach to online identity and security. It leverages
state-of-the-art public key cryptography, packaged as a user-friendly
desktop application.

HMX can be used for:

- single signon, without a central entity
- peer-to-peer encryption
- secure email delivery (replaces SMTP)
- repudiation or non-repudiation, at the user's discretion
- generic authorization, including virtual currency, and management of other
  digital entities

Details are still being worked out, but stay tuned for an alpha release in
2014.
