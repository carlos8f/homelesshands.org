title:  "S8F labs: The HMX protocol"
---

**TLDR; This is an idea for a trustless, crypto-backed
solution for moving and exchanging sensitive data through an untrusted network.
An alpha release is currently in development.**

_HMX is a Message eXchange_, or a _Hacker Mail rolodeX_, whichever you prefer.

E-mail is, ironically, *the most popularly trusted AND least secure internet
protocol in wide use*. How do we explain that?

### Introduction

Did you know that highly popular services such as
[Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/), [Google Talk](http://www.google.com/hangouts/),
[Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/), and
[WhatsApp](http://www.whatsapp.com/faq/general/21864047) don't
[end-to-end encrypt](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End-to-end_encryption) your
data? What this means for you is, **employees for these services have "backdoor"
encryption keys to forcibly decrypt your data**. By using these services, you have
agreed to let your precious data be siezed, altered, or silently monitored by
third parties without your express permission!

What's more, the NSA,
who has [paid RSA Security $10m USD](http://www.theverge.com/2013/12/20/5231006/nsa-paid-10-million-for-a-back-door-into-rsa-encryption-according-to)
to suppress the standardization of [superior crypto algorithms](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NTRU),
is [threatening secure email providers](http://www.zdnet.com/the-truth-about-why-silent-circle-silenced-their-secure-email-service-7000019300/),
and [illegally hacking the internet backbones](https://www.eff.org/nsa-spying)
to get at your data, in the name of "national security".

In light of all this, you owe it to yourself to protect your rights and to STOP
FEEDING THE MACHINE. HMX to the rescue.

### No data or service lock-in, no P2P hassle

HMX uses a **client-server** approach, and is **NOT a peer-to-peer network**. Other
solutions like [BitMessage](https://bitmessage.org/) leave the burden of message
passing and verification to your poor, overworked computer. What if you want
different "house rules" for your server or want to pay for an enhancement? What
if you don't want to re-transmit strangers' data all day? With a client-server
approach, you can run your own server, pay for a hosted one, or use the public
one of your choice. With P2P you only have a small number of public networks to
choose from, at best.

### Features

- Security by default: end-to-end **4096-bit RSA** asymmetric, **256-bit AES** symmetric, and **Diffie-Hellman** ephemeral encryption.
- Future support for [NTRU](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NTRU), a quantum-computing-resistant lattice-based cryptography.
- Users don't have to trust servers. Servers are merely the custodians of identities (pubkeys), and encrypted data blobs, with NO KNOWN backdoor keys.
- The HMX protocol is designed for a minimum of info leakage, so your web of trust is safe from prying eyes and data miners.
- Servers **MAY** authenticate WHO is posting a message, but they **MUST NOT** record it, or any other metadata.
- Addresses look like (and can also function as) email addresses!
- Automatically verifies messages using double-encoded SHA256 digital signatures.
- All interactions are client-server. No central server, signing authority,
  p2p network, or agency required.
- BSD-licensed

### Goals for HMX alpha

- Mail sending and checking via CLI
- Optional encryption, optional signing
- Basic keyserver functionality
- Data on server is immutable, but has configurable (on server) TTL
- Configurable (on server) payload size cap and random padding
- Hashcash required upon upload

### HMX 1.0 and beyond

- Linking scheme to upload payload spanning multiple messages
- Support NTRU or equivalent. RSA may already be cracked, and performance and bandwidth are factors!
- Timed delete by sender
- Merkle Tree upload confirmation signatures and validation
- Advanced keyserver w/ searching
- Instant messaging app or something else fun
- Optionally use DNS TXT records to create custom HMX server pointers (`username@your-host.com`).
- Servers can require pre-registration and signature authentication
- Postage fees, paid via Bitcoin wallet identity on keyserver
