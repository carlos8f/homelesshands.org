title:  "S8F labs: The HMX protocol"
---

**TLDR;** This is an idea for a trustless, crypto-backed
solution for moving and exchanging sensitive data through an untrusted network.
An alpha release is currently in development.

_HMX is a Message eXchange_, or a _Hacker Mail rolodeX_, whichever you prefer.

### Introduction

Did you know that highly popular services such as
[Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/), [Google Talk](http://www.google.com/hangouts/),
[Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/), and
[WhatsApp](http://www.whatsapp.com/faq/general/21864047) don't
[end-to-end encrypt](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End-to-end_encryption) your
data? What this means for you is, either employees for these services have "backdoor"
encryption keys to your data, or your data is residing in plaintext on their
servers. The so-called security of the modern web is, most of the time, merely a
marketing gimmick!

With HMX,

1. Once data leaves your computer, it cannot be decrypted until it reaches the
   computer of the recipient (end-to-end encryption).
2. Senders, recipients, unread message counts, etc. are not disclosed to the server,
   only to the recipient.
3. Public messages may provide an alternative to popular "paste bins", and
   can be cryptographically verified by everyone.
4. Data flow may be rate-limited by the server by requiring proof-of-work or credits.
5. Messages can be blind CC'ed to multiple addresses, or "mirrored", to facilitate
   public or private dissemination of information, and redundancy in case of
   "takedown" or network failure.

### No data or service lock-in, no P2P hassle

HMX uses a client-server approach, and is not a peer-to-peer network. Other
solutions like [BitMessage](https://bitmessage.org/) leave the burden of message
passing and verification to your poor, overworked computer. What if you want
different "house rules" for your server or want to pay for an enhancement? What
if you don't want to re-transmit strangers' data all day?

With a client-server approach, you can run your own server, pay for a hosted one,
or use the public one of your choice. With P2P you only have a small number of
public networks to choose from, at best.

### Features

- Security by default: end-to-end 4096-bit RSA asymmetric, 256-bit AES symmetric, and Diffie-Hellman ephemeral encryption.
- Future support for [NTRU](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NTRU), a quantum-computing-resistant lattice-based cryptography.
- Users don't have to trust servers. Servers are merely the custodians of identities (pubkeys), and encrypted data blobs, with no known backdoor keys.
- The HMX protocol is designed for a minimum of info leakage, so your web of trust is safe from prying eyes and data miners.
- Servers may authenticate who is posting a message, but they must not record it, or any other metadata.
- Addresses look like (and can also function as) email addresses!
- Automatically verifies received messages.
- All interactions are client-server. No central server, signing authority,
  p2p network, or agency required.
- BSD-licensed

### Goals for HMX alpha

- Mail sending and checking via CLI
- Optional encryption, optional signing
- Basic keyserver functionality
- Data on server is immutable, but has configurable (on server) TTL
- Configurable (on server) payload size cap and random padding
- Proof-of-work required to upload, perhaps employ "credit system"

### HMX 1.0 and beyond

- Linking scheme to upload payload spanning multiple messages
- Support NTRU or equivalent. RSA may already be cracked, and performance and bandwidth are factors!
- Timed delete by sender
- Proof-of-work system performed by clients to facilitate message flow and verification
- Signing public data, analogous to cryptographic "like" or "favorite"
- Public data could become permanent on server if it reaches enough signatures of registered users
- Advanced keyserver w/ searching
- Instant messaging app or something else fun
- Optionally use DNS TXT records to create custom HMX server pointers (`username@your-host.com`).
- Servers can require pre-registration and signature authentication
- Postage fees, paid via Bitcoin wallet identity on keyserver
