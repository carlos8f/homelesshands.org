I'm a longtime Street Fighter IV player, but up until recently my playstyle has been largely intuitive and reaction-based. Playing like that gets you to a certain point, and then I find myself consistently losing to theory-plus-reaction-based players.

To get past that plateau, I've started to study character "matchups", among other things. Knowing a matchup means you can watch your opponent for a certain move, and have a planned/practiced response, instead of having to improvise. It gives you a solid game plan and shifts the burden away from pure reaction/reads, giving you the ability to save the reads for critical junctures in the match.

One way to keep track of your matchup knowledge is with a simple win/loss table. As you complete matches, write down a `X` for a win, and a `O` for a loss, along with the character name. At the end of a session, mark the win/loss differential next to the character name, i.e. `+3` against Zangief and `-5` vs. Akuma. If your session lengths are consistent, you can use the differential to gauge how you're doing with the matchup. Also, you can add up all the differentials to get your overall strength.

I created a printable worksheet which is handy for this. Shoutouts to [PR Balrog](http://www.eventhubs.com/news/2014/feb/09/how-has-pr-balrog-performed-different-characters-ssf4-ae-v2012-check-out-spreadsheet/), who created an online spreadsheet and inspired me to do a printed version.

As an added bonus, I included the 5 new characters in the upcoming Ultra Street Fighter IV, for those lucky enough to have beta access.
