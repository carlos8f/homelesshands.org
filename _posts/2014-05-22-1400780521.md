title:  "Poster: Coffee Drinks Illustrated"
---

In 2010 I found
[this awesome coffee drink infographic](http://lokeshdhakar.com/coffee-drinks-illustrated/),
but at the time I couldn't find a PDF or vector version available. I wanted a large
print of it, so I took it upon myself to re-illustrate it using
[Inkscape](http://www.inkscape.org/), with some slight modifications so it shows up well in a
tabloid-format print.

I found afterwards that the author, Lokesh Dhakar, released a [vector version](http://lokeshdhakar.com/coffee-diagram-follow-up/),
but I still like the header and wide format that I created.

Thanks, Lokesh!
