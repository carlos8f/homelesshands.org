title:  "S8F labs: Base64 without inflating file size?"
---

We all know that base64-encoding a file increases its size, usually by a substantial
amount. But what happens to the size when you gzip that?

### Background

In my research for creating the [HMX protocol](https://s8f.org/1395871438/), I
have been searching for a format that is:

- portable (should be able to implement easily in any language)
- compressed (or able to be compressed on the transport level)
- secure (payload should be encrypted, with an optional transport-level security on top)
- streamable (headers should be readable before committing to read body)

While thinking about these requirements, I had an unusual idea. What happens
to a file's size when you do the following:

1. gzip it
2. encrypt it
3. base64 encode it
4. gzip it again?

I then designed a tool to do this using a fairly large file (SmartOS
installation ISO). The result was interesting: The original gzipped file was **157M**,
and the base64-encoded/double gzipped version was **158M**, only _1% larger_!

I'm still debating on whether I want to incorporate base64 at all in the protocol,
but the fact that it is usable without inflating the final download size, is
a rather interesting property.
