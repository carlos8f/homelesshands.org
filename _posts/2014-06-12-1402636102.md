## Introduction

Cyberpunking the internets. That's what you should be doing right now, and the Motley node.js framework makes it easy! Lovingly crafted in an efficient Model-View-Controller sytle, Motley combines the best tools for making websites:

- [schemaless, portable data layer](https://www.npmjs.org/package/modeler)
- [Handlebars views](https://www.npmjs.org/package/templ)
- [express-compatible](https://github.com/cpsubrian/node-expres)
  [middleware and controllers](https://www.npmjs.org/package/middler)
- [file server with in-memory cache](https://www.npmjs.org/package/buffet)
- [intelligent gzip compression and e-tag support](https://www.npmjs.org/package/dish)
- [session persistence and authentication](https://github.com/carlos8f/sess)
- [auto-loadable "plugin" application structure](https://gist.github.com/carlos8f/cd931ba95481a7570602)

...with stupidly awesome gist integration, allowing you to kickstart a prototype or venture into complete application development, all with just a couple shell commands.

It's worth noting that if you're coming from [express.js](http://expressjs.com/), Motley emulates many express/connect features, such as middleware, views, and sessions. In most cases, you'll be able to use your favorite connect/express middleware and port your apps with ease.

## Installation

`$ npm install -g motley`

## Famous two-line bootstrap

```
$ motley-init my-project 
$ motley my-project
server running at http://localhost:3000/
```

## One-line gist creation

```
$ motley-init --gist [--public] [--open] [my-project]
```

This will:

- prompt you for your github credentials, which are then exchanged
  for an [access token](https://www.npmjs.org/package/gist-cli) and cached at `~/.gist-login`
- create a gist containing [a new motley project](https://gist.github.com/carlos8f/b7d6f5b60306e63da635), optionally public with `--public`
- check out the gist's git repo via ssh, giving you version control
- optionally open your browser and point it to the gist with `--open`

Then you have a brand new web app, runnable with the `motley` binary, tied to a private git repo, backed by [gist.github.com](https://gist.github.com/), and all you had to do was type `motley-init`!

Simply run `motley` in the project directory, the web server will start, and edit the source code to do what you want!
