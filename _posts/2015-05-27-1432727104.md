title:  "autism"

I am autistic. I have a rare type of autism called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Savant_syndrome">Savant Syndrome</a>. It is rare and no one talks about it. But, I have lived my whole life like this and no one told me what I had. I found out just recently. I got books on it but they were all written for parents of children. I don't know who to turn to.

I tried to see a doctor but they wanted a diagnosis first. I went to the diagnosis person and they wanted $1000. I couldn't afford it. I left and I knew I had autism and no one understands. I also have Synesthesia, I am an open source programmer, I have a fighting game channel on youtube, I am a chess player, I know every note on hundreds of jazz records. I can recite all this music from heart. I have perfect pitch. Plz help.
