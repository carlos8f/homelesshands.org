title:  "Rediscovering musical counterpoint"
---

Counterpoint is one of the oldest musical traditions, yet it is a rarity to hear a [modern fugue](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLtZ5kwhU4k). Perhaps there are too many archaic rules to remember for many composers to bother. To me, a good fugue is like a puzzle, and once the listener hears the final chord, it is solved. There is a sense of wonder when notes clash and meander in their own directions, similar to colors mixing in a painting, or flavors mixing in a fine meal. This complexity is what I seek, and I want to bring counterpoint into the spotlight again with my own music.

Since Fall 2013, I've been planning a street music act. I want to incorporate a looper pedal, because looping is, in my opinion, the next evolution of the "one-man band". Now I've been thinking of using the looper with a keyboard to invoke counterpoint. With a monophonic or monotrimral instrument, or vocal, counterpoint is fully possible with one's self. I am excited to explore this idea more and ultimately find a mode of expression that suits me while still giving a nod to my fascination with early music.
