title:  "[video remix] Kei Nishikori - A Tennis Rocky Story"
---

On Saturday I watched [@keinishikori](https://twitter.com/keinishikori) emphatically dismantle the world #1 tennis player Novak Djokovic in the US Open semi-final. He became the first asian man to reach a Grand Slam final, a truly inspiring moment for Kei's career and the history of tennis.

Here you will find my humble tribute, a remix of footage of the match to the soundtrack from Rocky. I had lots of fun producing it and I hope you enjoy it as much as I did!
