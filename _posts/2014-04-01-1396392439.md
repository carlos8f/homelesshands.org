Administrators for the P2P Foundation recently traced the IP address of Satoshi
Nakamoto's [recent forum post](http://p2pfoundation.ning.com/forum/topics/bitcoin-open-source?commentId=2003008%3AComment%3A52186)
to a [cloaking tool](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinkerton_Government_Services)
used by government contractors. Was Bitcoin created by the NSA?

The truth is out there!
